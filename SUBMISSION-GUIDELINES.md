## Guidelines for submitting your HackSecret project

[Submit your HackSecret project here!](https://forms.monday.com/forms/5a15c44fd944198da2d319e53d7c0778?r=use1)

### Submission expectation

1. A video/Demo of your product, preferably contracts have a usable UI/Mockup to be shown.
2. A written description (max 2 pages, as Readme.md in your repository) covering:

- "User focused summary" of the created product (talk about what it does)
- "Investor pitch" - What is the problem it solves and where is the PMF?
- "Development Deepdive" - How did you build this, how do the contracts/functions interact and which design choices did you make.

3. The full code of your back and frontend under a (restrictive/permissive) open source license

NOTE: The jury will compile the codebase and only judge protocols that properly compile with the listed dependencies, this also accounts for UIs or other product deliverables. Adding Tests to your codebase is preferred.

### Prize selection

Lastly the form will allow you to choose a sponsor track to commit your challenge too, if your project leverages the contracts or challenges of multiple teams you can pick up to a maximum of 2 sponsors to show your project too. Prize handout by the sponsors is at full discretion of the team at hand. Every team is automatically put forward for the main hackathon prize (NOTE: As long as a secret contract is created or called for the dApp) of 10.000SCRT divided over the top 3 and a 20.000 USD denominated mainnet grant.

### Jury result

Jury result will be created asynchronously and provided at the end of the hackathon - Friday 19th of May. The jury consists of a representative of every Sponsor together with Guy Zysking (founder of Secret Network) and Itzik Grossman (CTO of SCRT Labs). All projects will be judged on 4 different categories - Creativity, code quality, PMF, Leverage of existing contracts.
