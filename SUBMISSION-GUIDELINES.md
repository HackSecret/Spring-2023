### Submission expectation

1. A video/Demo of your product, preferably contracts have a usable UI/Mockup to be shown.
2. A written description (max 2 pages, as Readme.md in your repository) covering:
  - "User focused summary" of the created product (talk about what it does)

  - "Development Deepdive" - How did you build this, how do the contracts/functions interact and which design choices did you make.

### Presentation/Demo
Additionally we will ask all teams to pick a timeslot in the last week of the hackathon to present their creation. This presentation will be in a 15 min lightning format where you are expected to cover "Problem", "solution" and "Design" in 15 minutes with an additional 10 minutes for Jury questions.

### Prize selection
Lastly the form will allow you to choose a sponsor track to commit your challenge too, if your project leverages the contracts or challenges of multiple teams you can pick up to a maximum of 2 sponsors to show your project too. Prize handout by the sponsors is at full discretion of the team at hand. Every team is automatically put forward for the main hackathon prize (NOTE: As long as a secret contract is created or called for the dApp) of 10.000SCRT devided over the top 3 and a 20.000 USD denominated mainnet grant.

### Jury result
Jury result will be created asynchronously and provided at the end of the hackathon - Friday 19th of May. The jury consists of a representative of every Sponsor together with Guy zysking (founder of Secret Network) and Itzik Grossman (CTO of SCRT Labs). All projects will be judged on 4 different categories - Creativity, code quality, PMF, Leverage of existing contracts.
